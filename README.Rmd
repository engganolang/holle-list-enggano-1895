This repository contains processed, digitised word list data of Enggano (investigated in 1895) in the Holle List by Stokhof and Almanar (1987). In addition, the repository provides the R codes to process the raw word list into tabular format that conforms to the specification of the Wordlist module in the Cross-Linguistic Data Formats (CLDF). The tabular format is generated via combining the raw Enggano word list data with the main, new basic list of the Holle List in Stockhof (1980) that has been [digitised by Rajeg (2023)](https://engganolang.github.io/digitised-holle-list/).
