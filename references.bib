This Cross-Linguistic Data Format (CLDF) data was read into R using the rcldf R package by Simon J. Greenhill. This ACD dataset is used to link an Enggano form to its Proto-Austronesian and/or Proto-Malayo Polynesian reconstructed forms to be viewed online in the ACD.The pyconcepticon Python module was used to create the first mapping of the English gloss with the Concepticon concepts, followed by manual post-editing (changes tracked on the GitHub repository).},
